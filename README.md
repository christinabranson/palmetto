Palmetto is a WordPress theme designed specifically for real estate and rental agencies. It features modules on the home page designed to showcase featured listings. It also has a number of custom page templates, including a listing template to showcase property information.

## Requirements
* This theme was built on Wordpress 4.5.2 and I intend to update it as needed to be compatible with new versions.
* Some of the functionality on the listing page is to be used with the Advanced Custom Fields plugin in order to supply standard real estate tokens.

### General
* This theme is built using the Foundation front-end framework. As a result, it is meant to be fully responsive across all devices. It should be compatible with all major web browsers.

### Documentation
